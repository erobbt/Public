## Background

As a skilled web developer, I am excited to express my interest in any entry to mid-level positions available within your organization.

Last year, I completed a website redesign and rebuild using Bootstrap 5 and Next JS, a React framework. This project involved converting a classic ASP and HTML4 site into an HTML5 responsive Next.js design. I utilized VSCode for development and stored the site's repository on GitHub, deploying it with Vercel. 

Currently, the site is being upgraded to Next.js 14 and its App Router. This includes implementing TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite components, among other enhancements.

I am confident that my 18+ years experience and technical abilities will make me a valuable addition to your team. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Regards,

Earl Robb
