## Background

As a skilled web developer, I am excited to express my interest in any entry to mid-level positions available within your organization.

Recently, I completed a website redesign and rebuild using Bootstrap 5 and Next JS, a React framework. This project involved converting a classic ASP and HTML4 site into an HTML5 responsive Next.js design. I utilized VSCode for development and stored the site's repository on GitHub, deploying it with Vercel. 

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, my previous employer had to close down, and COVID-19 extended my time away from the job market. However, I have taken this time to sharpen my skills and am now eager to re-enter the workforce.

I am confident that my 18+ years experience and technical abilities will make me a valuable addition to your team. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Regards,

Earl Robb
