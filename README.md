## Background

As a skilled web developer, I am excited to express my interest in any entry to mid-level web developer positions available within your organization.

Last year, I completed a website redesign and rebuild using Bootstrap 5 and Next JS, a React framework. This project ( www.turkeyshoottargets.com  ) involved converting a classic ASP and HTML4 site into an HTML5 responsive Next.js 12 pages design. I utilized VSCode for development and stored the site's repository on GitHub, deploying it with Vercel. 

The site is being upgraded to Next.js 14 using the App Router. This upgrade includes implementing Typescript, Flowbite, Tailwind, react-hook-form, and Zod. Parallel routes are used together with Intercepting routes to create modals.

I am confident that my 18+ years experience and technical abilities will make me a valuable addition to your team. 

Regards,

Earl Robb
